We have always loved how [Flux handles Secrets with SOPS](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/), it's such a seamless experience. However we have noticed, that it's kind of hard to actually distribute keys to users in a kubernetes native way. That's why we built this operator. It introduces [Providers](docs/usage.md#providers), which essentially match Kubernetes resources which represent Keys or access to KMS stores. On the Provides you also declare, which [Secrets](docs/usage.md#secrets) you want to encrypt with that provider. **Currently only works with PGP and AGE for n-secrets** That leaves open that, N-providers can load private keys for one Secret, in complex scenarios.

> Regarding the code, most of the SOPS implementation was taken from the [Flux kustomize-constroller](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/blob/main/internal/decryptor/decryptor.go) project. We have left the License-Header as-is, if further attribution is wished, please open an issue. We go the idea from the existing [sops-operator](https://github.com/isindir/sops-secrets-operator). However the implementation was not optimal for our use-cases, that's why we decided to release our own solution.
